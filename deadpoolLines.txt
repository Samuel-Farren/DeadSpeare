 Kinda lonesome back here.

 Little help?

 Excuse me.

 Pool. Dead.

 Mmm. Nice.

 Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.

 Dopinder, I’m starting to think there’s a reason I’m in this cab today.

 No, my slender, brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.

 So you gotta hold onto love. Tight!

 And never let go. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Got it?

 Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.

 Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.

 I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it’s bad.

 Oh, that’s because it’s Christmas Day, Dopinder. And I’m after someone on my naughty list. I’ve been waiting one year, three weeks, six days, and oh…

 Fourteen minutes to make him fix what he did to me.

 This shit.

 Boo!

 Aw, shit! I forgot my ammo bag!

 Nope, no time. Fuck it. I got this. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve bullets, or bust. We’re here!

 I, I never carry a wallet while I’m working. Ruins the lines of my suit.

 But, uh, how ‘bout a crisp high-five!

 Merry Christmas.

 Wha- Oh! Oh, hello. I know, right? Who’s balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie? I can’t tell you, but it does rhyme with Pullverine. And let me tell you; (In an Australian accent) he’s got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under. Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix, and - oh! Bad guys to kill.

 Maximum effort.

 Rich, corinthian leather.

 I’m looking for Francis. Have you seen this man?

 I’ve never said this, but don’t swallow.

 Shit. Did I leave the stove on?

 Hey! Oh!

 Wait! You may be wondering, why the red suit? Well, that’s so bad guys can’t see me bleed. This guy’s got the right idea.

 He wore the brown pants.

 Fine! I only have twelve bullets, so you’re going to have to share. Let’s count ‘em down.

 Shit.

 Mother fucker! Ten. (He shoots and misses). Shit! Nine. (He shoots and misses). Fuck! Eight. (He shoots and misses). Shit fuck!

 Bad Deadpool.

 Seven. Good Deadpool.

 Someone’s not counting.

 Six.

 Four.

 Ah! Right up main street.

 Ooh. I’m touching myself tonight.

 Francis! Francis!

 What the shit biscuit! Where you at, Francis?

 Ugh. You’re not Francis.

 Really? Rolling up the sleeves?

 (Narrating) You’re probably thinking, ‘My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie, but this guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kebab.’ Well, I may be super, but I am no hero. And yeah, technically, this is a murder. But some of the best love stories start with a murder. And that’s exactly what this is. A love story. And to tell it right, I gotta take you back to way before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.

 Shoulda brought my roller blades, show these kids how it’s done.

 And that’s why we do it. But mostly the money.

 If I give a guy a pavement facial, it’s cause he’s earned it.

 No, no, no, no, no. That I ain't.

 Now, if I were a two-hundred pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide? Oh.

 A hush falls over the crowd. Rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan lines up the shot. His form looks good.

 And that's why Regina rhymes with fun. Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge.

 Oh! Giving him the business.

 Incoming!

 This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!

 Looking good, Francis. Well rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching. Ringing any bells? No?

 How about now?

 Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Sharpei. Yeah, and whose fault is that, Francis? Time to undo what you did to this butterface.

 Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late '90s.

 Dad?

 (Narrating) I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.

 (Narrating) Well, maybe not the most.

  Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing. Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass. Dry cleaning-discounts, lucrative film deals both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies. Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.

 I'm not talking to you. I was talking to them.

 Look, Colossus! I don't have time for the goody-two-shoes bullshit right now! And... you are?

 Negasonic Teenage... What the shit? That's the coolest name ever! So what, you're like his sidekick?

 Let me guess. X-men left you behind on, what, shit detail?

 Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Trade names?

 Look! I'm a teenage girl! I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences. So what's it gonna be, huh? Long sullen silence, or mean comment? Go on.

 Ah-hah!

 You big, chrome, cock-gobbler!

 You're really gonna fuck this up for me? Trust me. That wheezing bag of dick tips has it coming! He's pure evil! Besides, nobody's getting hurt!

 That guy was already up there when I got here.

 Heads up.

 Listen, the day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler, who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland mansion of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking mother fucker, on that day... I'll send your shiny happy ass a friend request. But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do. Either that, or slap the bitch out of you.

 And I hope you're watching!

 That does it!

 Oh, Canada! That's not good.

 Cock shot!

 Oh, your poor wife!

 All the dinosaurs feared the T-rex.

 Ah! I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!

 You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?

 Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the on switch?

 McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing. Dead or alive you're coming with me!

 (To the camera) You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.

 Oh, there's the money shot, baby! Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.

 Rock, meet Bottom. When life ends up breath-takingly fucked, you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.

 This shit's gonna have nuts in it.

 Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?

 He made me ask twice. Is it the mask?

 You're about to be killed by a Zamboni!

 Nice to see you, Jared. I'll take the footlong. Fully loaded.

 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89. About to be 90.

 Ding ding!

 Ha! Only on the outside.

 This is not gonna end well for you, no. Where's your boss?

 Ah, da, da, da, da ,da ,da, da. Oh, you'll tell me. But first, you might want to look away for this.

 Now this little piggy went to...

 Thank you, Agent Smith.

 And we all know how this turned out.

 Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.

 There. All caught up.

 Sorry about bleeding in all of your garbage! Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Whoo! Some kinds of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said, when it comes time for licking wounds, there's no place like home. And I share that home with someone you've met. The old blind lady from the laundry mat, Al.

 Her. Ah! Fourth wall break in a fourth wall break. That's like... sixteen walls! She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old. And black. And blind. And I think she's in love with me. Wait, I'm pretty sure Robin loves Batman too.

 Al?

 Good morning, sleepy head. It smells like old lady pants in here.

 But you're no lady.

 Oh! So comfy.

 You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?

 Sit on a stick.

 Yeah. Bactine should do it.

 How's that Cunen coming along? IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.

 Please. Anything's an improvement over the Holdall. I'd have taken and Emness or a Tristes over the Holdall. No, I didn't get excited until I saw the Cunen.

 Here? Now? Just kidding, I know it's been decades.

 Pretty grossed out.

 And I quote, 'Looking for blind and likes imperfections, must be good with hands.' Or would you rather I build the ikea and you pay rent?

 Let's recap. The cock-thistle that turned me into this freak slipped through my arms today. Arm. Catching him my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back, and prevent this shit from happening to someone else. So yeah, today was about as much fun as a sand paper dildo.

 Hashtag drive by.

 I'd stick that where you stuck the Bactine. I raided my stash of wisdom teeth Percocet and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.

 I appreciate the gesture.

 It's about the size of a KFC spork.

 I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo, she wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand.

 Looks are everything! You ever heard David Beckham speak? It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium! You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?

 No. You're blind.

 No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty, and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan. In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand. Go, go, go, go, go ,go.

 I can't believe I'm doing this. Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?

 Ugh, fuck me.

 We've got to find her fast, before numbnuts does.

 Cause I'm constantly stalking the fox.

 (Narrating) Every time I see her, it's like the first time. Especially from this angle.

 You weak motherfucker! Come on. Come on, get it together. This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa. Here we go. Maximum effort.

 Hey, hey! Where'd she go?

 Fuck... Mother fucker!

 Chocolate! Jimminy! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, I'm gonna rip this mother fucking -

 Find that! Find that, I'm going to get angry!

 What is that?

 I need guns.

 I need all the guns!

 Well, we all know what I can do with twelve.

 Careful with that, Ronnie Milsap. We're downrange.

 I told you, we're going with the Oordvash, not the Bjorsha, get it through your head or get outta fuck town!

 Na, na, na, na, na. Let's go, cough it up. Up, up, up, up, up.

 Ugh, down, down, down.

 Listen, Al. If I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much. Oh, and also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.

 Ripley! From Alien 3!

 Ha! Fake laugh, hiding real pain. Go get silver balls.

 Oh, like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money. No, you know that bad guy that you let go? He's got my girl. You're gonna help me get her back.

 It's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse! I'm gonna wait out here, okay? Big house. It's funny that we only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man.

 And that is why, in my opinion, the movie cocoon is pure pornography.

 Twinkly, but deadly. My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid. In exchange, I told him I would consider joining his boy band.

 Sure it's not. Ah! So, any luck winning Gita back?

 Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.

 Dopinder.

 What was that?

 For you? Ten! Okay guys, let's get out there and make a difference! (You know what to do).

 Time to make the chimi fucking changas. Not often a dude ruins your face, wall stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby-momma, and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.

 God damn it! I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way. With two swords and maximum effort. Cue the music.

 Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for you.

 Superhero landing, she's gonna do a superhero landing, wait for it!

 Woo! Superhero landing. You know, that's really hard on your knees. Totally impractical. They all do it. You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis. That's why I brought him.

 I mean... That's why I brought her?

 Oh, no, finish your tweet. Just give us a second. There you go, hashtag it. Go get her tiger.

 Oh, I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.

 Finish fucking her the fuck up!

 Suck a cock!

 Look away, child. Look away!

 Wait! Wait!

 Hey, you only work for that shit spackled muffin fart! So, I'mma give y'all a chance to lay down your firearms, in exchange for preferential, borderline gentle, possibly lover-like treatment.

 Fine! Commando.

 Bob?

 Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since -

 TGI Friday's!

 What the hell! Come here you.

 How are the kids? Good? And Gale, she still fixing that tuna casserole? So good. Bad for the waistline if you know what I mean.

 Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.

 Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants. You're right, beautiful! Red really is my color.

 Don't worry, baby. I'm gonna get you out of that shitbox.

 Oh, you never left.

 I hope they've blocked pain to your every last nerve, cause I'mma go looking!

 Good one. Yeah, that was a good one. Let's dance. And by dance, I mean let's try to kill each other.

 Sounds like your last Saturday night.

 I got you, baby. I got a plan, but you're not gonna like it.

 Don't worry, I'm totally on top of this.

 Damn it! Maximum effort!

 Yoo-hoo! Oh, my God, that was so awe -

 There are no words... Me and you... Are headed to fix this butterface.

 What?

 No, no! So you mean to say, after all this, you cant fix me.

 Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?

 Any last words?

 Who fucking cares?

 I'm sorry?

 To...?

 You were droning on! Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least fuckface won't heal from that. If wearing superhero tights means sparing psychopaths, then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you.

 Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy about to stand in front of a girl. And tell her... What the fuck am I going to tell her?

 I can't even tell you -

 I deserve that.

 That too.

 No, no, no, no, maybe not the nethers.

 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. I'm sorry for leaving, I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner. It's been a rough couple of years.

 I live in a crack house. With a family of 12. Every night we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle, she's the fattest. There's nothing that we don't share. Floorspace, dental floss, even condoms.

 I should have come and found you sooner. But baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one you remember.

 And this one.

 And this one. In case the other fell off. Just, yeah, ow, like a bandaid, just give it a good - Audi 5000! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?

 Yeah.

 I'm not the same underneath this suit either. Super penis.

 What are... What are you still doing here? Get out of here, go make yourself useful! You, go be a really big brother to someone. Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn. And you, chicken noodle, nothing compares to you. Sinead O'Connor, 1990.

 What in the ass! That was not mean! I'm proud of you.

 You know, for a second there, it felt like we were three mini lion robots coming together to form one super robot.

 Yeah. And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for.

 Wham! As promised.

 (Narrating) See? You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl. The right girl will bring out the hero in you. Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, there we go, looks nice, it's gonna be the only thing pulling out tonight. Who doesn't love a happy ending? Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy, saying, I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you...

 You're still here? It's over, go home. Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2. Well, we don't have that kind of money. What, are you expecting Sam Jackson to show up, with an eye patch and a saucy little leather number? Go home! Oh! But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret: We're gonna have Cable. Amazing character, mechanic arm, time travel. We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet, but it could be anybody. Just need a big guy with a flat top. Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley. She's got range, who knows. Big secret. Shh. Oh, and don't leave your garbage lying around. It's a total dick move. Chicka-chicka.
