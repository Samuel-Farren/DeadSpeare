Kinda lonesome back here.::

Little help?::

Excuse me.::

Pool. Dead.::

Mmm. Nice.::

 Not the Daffodil Daydream.::
 The girl.::

 Dopinder, I’m starting to think there’s a reason I’m in this cab today.::

 No, my slender, brown friend.:: 
Love is a beautiful thing.:: 
When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.::

 So you gotta hold onto love.:: 
Tight!::

 And never let go.:: 
Don’t make the same mistakes I did.:: 
Got it?::

 Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.::
